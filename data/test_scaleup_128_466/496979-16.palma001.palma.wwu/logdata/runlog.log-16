WARNING: It appears that your OpenFabrics subsystem is configured to only
allow registering part of your physical memory.  This can cause MPI jobs to
run with erratic performance, hang, and/or crash.

This may be caused by your OpenFabrics vendor limiting the amount of
physical memory that can be registered.  You should investigate the
relevant Linux kernel module parameters that control how much physical
memory can be registered, and increase them to allow registering all
physical memory on your machine.

See this Open MPI FAQ item for more information on these Linux kernel module
parameters:

  Total memory:            48449 MiB

Your MPI job will continue, but may be behave poorly and/or hang.

Error File for Elliptic Model Problem Dune::Multiscale::Problem::IModelProblemData with epsilon = 0.05.

Use MsFEM in Petrov-Galerkin formulation with an uniform computation, i.e.:
Uniformly refined coarse and fine mesh and
the same number of layers for each (oversampled) local grid computation.

Computations were made for:

Refinement Level for (uniform) Fine Grid = 4
Refinement Level for (uniform) Coarse Grid = 0
Oversampling Strategy = 1
Number of layers for oversampling = 0

Comparison with standard FEM computation on the MsFEM Fine Grid, i.e. on Refinement Level 4
