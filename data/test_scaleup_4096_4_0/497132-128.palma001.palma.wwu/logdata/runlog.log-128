Error File for Elliptic Model Problem Dune::Multiscale::Problem::IModelProblemData with epsilon = 0.05.

Use MsFEM in Petrov-Galerkin formulation with an uniform computation, i.e.:
Uniformly refined coarse and fine mesh and
the same number of layers for each (oversampled) local grid computation.

Computations were made for:

Refinement Level for (uniform) Fine Grid = 4
Refinement Level for (uniform) Coarse Grid = 0
Oversampling Strategy = 1
Number of layers for oversampling = 0

Comparison with standard FEM computation on the MsFEM Fine Grid, i.e. on Refinement Level 4
